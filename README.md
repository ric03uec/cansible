[![Run Status](https://api.shippable.com/projects/5afd82bed9a4de0700aa0e34/badge?branch=master)](https://app.shippable.com/github/ric03uec/cansible)

## Goals
- keep docker as the only dependency to run this
- minimal image with alpine (or something lightweight as the base)
- keep this synchronized with ansible releases
